## Game Rules
- The game is played on a 4x4 grid.
- Each turn, a new tile (2 or 4) randomly appears in an empty spot on the board.
- Slide tiles using the arrow keys (or swipe on mobile) to move all tiles in the chosen direction.
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values.
- The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048, but you can continue playing to achieve higher scores.
